Objective : 
1. Building a system that supports 1 users
2. Scaling it up to serve million of users


Requirement - 
- Server serves both to web and mobile apps


Building step by step:-
There is always area of endless improvement and gradual refinement

1. Single Server Setup

- Everything is running on same server
  - Web Server 
  - Database
  - Cache




2. Separating Web and Data Tier

- Separation allows them to be scaled independently
- Choosing between SQL and NOSQL based on specific use case



3. Horizontal(Scale out) VS Vertical(Scale up) Scaling

- Vertical - no failover and redundancy, hard limit 
- Horizontal - Desirable in large scale application




4. Load Balancer

- LB evenly distributes the incoming request among web server
- Client is connected through public IP of LB and web server has private IP





5. DataBase Replication

- Divides the data tier into master-slave
- All write operation must be sent to Master 
- All read operation must be sent to Slave
